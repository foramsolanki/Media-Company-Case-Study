# Media-Company-Case-Study

Problem Statement: A digital media company (similar to Voot, Hotstar, Netflix, etc.) had launched a show. Initially, the show got a good response, but then witnessed a decline in viewership. The company wants to figure out what went wrong.

conclusion :  Ad Impressions and Character A as the driver variables that could be used to increase the viewership of the show. Ad impressions are directly proportional to the marketing budget. Thus, by increasing the marketing budget, better viewership could be achieved. Similarly, Character A’s absence and presence create a significant change in show viewership. Character A’s presence brings viewers to the show. Thus, these two variables can be acted upon to improve the show viewership.
